# PropertyAnalysis
This folder contains my internship project associated with MVP Studio. For the onboarding task, I have completed property analysis for the Australian property market. 
The task that I completed is given below:
have created a Data warehouse report by creating the primary key for each table. have written queries to find out these results:

1) Find out the number of cities in each state.

2) Find out the number of unique postcodes, and suburbs in each city.

3) Query the Average Property Median Value by Suburb, and by Postcode separately, and then by Suburb and Postcode together. Then put a Where condition to remove those records where there is no median value.

After that, I built a Power BI report to visualize the Average property median value by suburb, city, and by postcode. 
I have used Power BI and connected it to the database on my computer, imported data into Power BI from the above tables, and connected the tables based on common columns.
Have done some data transformation and data cleansing by using Power Query Editor. The visualization was made based on these categories:

1) Build visualizations to display Average Property Median Value by City/Town, Suburb, and by Postcode.
2) Categorize Median Value into Groups 0-750k, $750k-$1.5M, $1.5M-$2.5M, $2.5M+, then show the Number of Properties in each category.
Show properties on Geographic Map using Lat and Lon  with Property Median Value.
3) Put slicers for City/Town, Suburb, Postcode, and range of Property Median Value.
